## About this Workshop

This workshop will walk you through the process to deploy and configure an end-to-end monitoring solution for Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) using Logging Analytics, Monitoring and other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Services.
This solutions offers collection of various logs of a Kubernetes cluster into OCI Logging Analytics and offer rich analytics on top of the collected logs. Users may choose to customise the log collection by modifying the out of the box configuration that it provides.

OKE or Kubernetes comes up with some built-in services where each one has different responsibilities and they run on one or more nodes in the cluster either as Deployments or DaemonSets. 
"Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Specifically, they can describe:

- What containerized applications are running (and on which nodes)
- The resources available to those applications
- The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance"
